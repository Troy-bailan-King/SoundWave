# Create SoundWave-syndicate

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I run this project?

Using Linux cd to the folder and run `npm create t3-app@latest` to download T3 module, maybe you also need to run `npm install`.  



Then you need to creat a '.env' file in root becuase github will Ignore this file, you will not get this file when you clone. 

Then you can copy code from '.env.example' to '.env'. 



I think you can run this project. I am not sure about mac os.
